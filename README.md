# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions 
<br> 
This repository contains projects aimed at developing models to detect and flag potentially fraudulent financial activities across various domains.
The projects are organized into three main folders: CreditCardFraudDetection, InsuranceFraud, and OnlinePaymentFraud. Each folder includes models to predict fraudulent activities specific to that domain.
